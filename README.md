# Cyclistic Data-GDA

## Project Summary

#### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the bike-sharing company's revenue by understanding and targeting the behavioral differences between two user segments: "casual" riders, who pay per ride, and annual members, who subscribe to the service. The overarching business task is to identify key insights that will enable the creation of a focused and compelling marketing message to encourage casual users to transition to the annual subscription.

The project aims to provide actionable insights for the marketing team to develop a persuasive campaign that addresses the specific needs and preferences of casual users, ultimately driving increased adoption of annual subscriptions. The success of this initiative will be measured by the conversion rate of casual users to annual memberships and the subsequent impact on the company's overall revenue.

# Cyclistic Data-GDA

## Project Summary

#### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the bike-sharing company's revenue by understanding and targeting the behavioral differences between two user segments: "casual" riders, who pay per ride, and annual members, who subscribe to the service. The overarching business task is to identify key insights that will enable the creation of a focused and compelling marketing message to encourage casual users to transition to the annual subscription.

**1. Identify the Business Task:**
   - Focus on improving earnings by converting casual riders to annual subscriptions.
   - Analyze behavioral differences between casual and annual users.

**2. Consider Key Stakeholders:**
   - Director of Marketing, Lily Moreno (Project Manager), Marketing Analytics Team, Cyclistic Executive Team.

**3. Define the Business Task:**
   - Investigate and understand differences between casual and annual users.
   - Formulate a targeted marketing campaign to incentivize casual users to switch to annual subscriptions.

**Key Question:**
   - What motivates casual users to transition to an annual subscription, based on their behavior?

The project aims to provide actionable insights for the marketing team to develop a persuasive campaign that addresses the specific needs and preferences of casual users, ultimately driving increased adoption of annual subscriptions. The success of this initiative will be measured by the conversion rate of casual users to annual memberships and the subsequent impact on the company's overall revenue.
